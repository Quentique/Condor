        Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="patent">3. Grant of Patent License</a></strong>. Subject to the terms
        and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
        perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
        offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
        license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
        that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
        combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
        Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against
        any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
        that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
        direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the
        date such litigation is filed.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="redistribution">4. Redistribution</a></strong>. You may reproduce and
        distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
        with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that
        You meet the following conditions:</p>
    <ol style="list-style: lower-latin;">
        <li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
            copy of this License; and</li>

        <li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that You changed the files; and</li>

        <li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
            distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
            the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
            any part of the Derivative Works; and</li>

        <li>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
            then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
            of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
            those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
            at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
            if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
            by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
            appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
            and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
            within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
            the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
            notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
            <br>
            <br>
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
            provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
            reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
            Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
            distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
            this License.
        </li>

    </ol>

    <p><strong><a name="contributions">5. Submission of Contributions</a></strong>. Unless You
        explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for
        inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
        conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
        terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
        regarding such Contributions.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="trademarks">6. Trademarks</a></strong>. This License does not grant
        permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product
        names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
        NOTICE file.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="no-warranty">7. Disclaimer of Warranty</a></strong>. Unless required by
        applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and
        each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
        without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You
        are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
        redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise
        of permissions under this License.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="no-liability">8. Limitation of Liability</a></strong>. In no event and
        under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
        otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
        grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
        of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including
        but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
        even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
        damages.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="additional">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</a></strong>.
        While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
        and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
        and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
        harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
        Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
        liability.</p>
